TO DO
=============

--Should we consider moving P1 measurement to keg, not regulator? i.e., put T to P1 downstream of Checkvalve

--Do we need to "debounce" with delays? do they even work?

--Remove SwitchModeState code

--DARDEN: Why NOT leave S3 open after depressurization, to account for case where bottle depressurizes quickly and THEN foams. Can get a mini spew if foam and pressure build after platform starts to lower. Answer: I think we are already leaving B3 open until platform drops. Maybe we should add a fill sensor check to platform down?

--DARDEN: Several times had to reboot when machine stuck at "B2 toggles filling, B3 toggles exhaust" screen. I think bottle was empty and pressurized in this state, or possibly after a foam tamp. FillState is not checked before the Fill Loop...maybe add a FillState check before the fill loop, to prevent the FillState being set to low somehow, making it impossible to get back to the fill loop? [UPDATE: On Oct 6 video call with rebecca, watched machine lock twice after closing door. Bottle was empty and pressurized, but no buttons were active. THis tends to support hypothesis about fillstate being set low, and not being able to get into filling loop. All buttons unlit, btw, and inactive. Screen is "B2 toggles, B3 toggles exhaust" ]

--DARDEN: Had to reboot after adjusting Autosiphon value once.

--DARDEN: After a "Filling too fast" error, make user restart flow with B2

--With Needle Valve shut completely, when filling, Reg = 40.7 BOttle = 34.7. When B2 is toggled off, bottle goes up to 38.2. Why does it go up??

--Pressing B3 to open door: When you leave your finger on B3, Platform Down activates.

--Need to find way to eliminate screen flicker on pressure measurements

--MANUAL MODE. Shouldn't B2 be labled liquid IN?. 

--MANUAL MODE: Just report REG and BOTTLE pressure...not Diff

--MANUAL MODE: Should we remove the pressure check? Ie, B2 opens valve whether or not bottle is pressurized. (But door must be closed)

--MANUAL MODE: After filling cycle, platform down gets locked out if you take finger off B3. Hitting B1 will release, but shouldn't hvae to do that

--Manual Mode: Buttons should light.

--No need to show regulator pressure all the time, is there? Just in Idle state.

--With highly conductive liquids, machine sometimes locks after overfill detecttion. this is becasue we are MEASURING the fill state after overfill. Should just SET sensorFillState to LOW rather than meassuring it to force into depressurize loop. This is what we do after detecting foam. BUT--think about case where liquid doesn't siphone down and stays in contact with fill sensor. Then what?

--Can we integrate QA firmware into main? Maybe holding B1+B3 on bootup ==> repeating test phase

--Since bootloader appears to no longer load, may need to introduce slight delay at boot to be able to get to menu or manual mode or EEProm set or QA routine.

--Should be able to get to Menu with no gas attached

--Shouldn't do bootup routine when stuck bottle is detected--confusing (remember Aspen)

--Need way to drop platform w no gas

--Bad bug in filling loop found in NY. Upon closing door, would several times start to fill and then stop, with no liquid coming out (eew--that could be an S2 problem)

--Had the problem in NY were often the bottle would continue to foam after depressurization target was reached but before platform dropped. Why the delay? could we leave s3 open?


--Make button combo to reach menu on bootup same as in main loop (B2 + B3)

--Make null pressure catch on bootup and pressure sag loop warnings, not trapped loops. Should still be able to open door in null pressure state

--Sometimes foam sensing isn't working (Las Vegas). More sensitive resistor?

--When "no bottle" test gives false "no bottle" indication, depressurize bottle completely (has several psi). Or move the window of time over which the test is down downstream by 50 ms

--When there is heavy foaming after pressure reaches downward threshold but before platform release, foam sometimes doesn't trip sensor. Do we want to tamp here? This can trigger a "Close door" message when foam hits sensor after depressurtion complete but before platform falls (outgassing causes pressure to go up over threshold, causing the door close message to come up. // We are nowkeeping S3 open now UNTIL platform falls. We could have a tamp routine in the main loop.

--Consider blinking a button if it is active and could do something? B1 when platform is down; B2 when filling; B3 to depress, lower, open. Probably not.

--Tip fell off once at SACC

--Door sticks sometimes due to stickiness and sometimes due to rubbing.

--Buff out menu routine

--Add half seconds to autosiphonduration

--Fix lifetime cycles so can go over 255

--vent bottle in pressureDropped loop

--get new start pressure after null loops

--when liquid out connection from keg is not connected (or line is blocked), behavior is the same as filling too fast--pressure goes up. Is there any way to alert user to this? Manual mode

--In idle loop with platform down, change instructions to 

Insert Bottle
B3 opens door

if door is closed

--Make all constants proportional to reg. pressure--WON"T FIX

--Don't EVER drop platform when pressurized.

--IMMEDIATELY close platformUP solenoid if Preg < Pbot and maybe open vent solenoid. This would indicate that gas was turned off with a pressurized bottle in place; closing S4 will lessen the chance that slider pressure will sag and cause a bang.

--Fix funny button flash that happens when no-bottle loop runs when exiting pressure loop

--Raised platform; turned off gas, disconnected gas hose and depressurized, closed door and liquid spewed!!!!!!!!!! FIXED with second pressure sensor

--Should be able to open door in null loop--how else can you get it open to pack it, etc?

--Open door at start (or certainly after a stuck bottle start up)

--Opening door triggers momentary platform down

--Would be nice to shut off gas if bottle pressure isn't rising (ie, no bottle in place)

--Purge no longer works

--closing door with platform up and no bottle starts gas. Button isn't lit. 

--750s wont fill!! closing door only gives a momentary burst of gas

--Button toggle functionality is wonky--if you leave pushed too long, it toggles again WOO HOO

--When bottle automatically depressurizes and platform drops slightly, doesn't end up in right state. Must push B3 again to make right

--When keg runs out of liquid, pressure reading is near zero and buttons don't work right
