TO DO
=============

--Need way to drop platform w no gas

--Bad bug in filling loop found in NY. Upon closing door, would several times start to fill and then stop, with no liquid coming out (eew--that could be an S2 problem)

--Had the problem in NY were often the bottle would continue to foam after depressurization target was reached but before platform dropped. Why the delay? could we leave s3 open?


--Make button combo to reach menu on bootup same as in main loop (B2 + B3)

--Make null pressure catch on bootup and pressure sag loop warnings, not trapped loops. Should still be able to open door in null pressure state

--Sometimes foam sensing isn't working (Las Vegas). More sensitive resistor?

--When "no bottle" test gives false "no bottle" indication, depressurize bottle completely (has several psi). Or move the window of time over which the test is down downstream by 50 ms

--When there is heavy foaming after pressure reaches downward threshold but before platform release, foam sometimes doesn't trip sensor. Do we want to tamp here? This can trigger a "Close door" message when foam hits sensor after depressurtion complete but before platform falls (outgassing causes pressure to go up over threshold, causing the door close message to come up. // We are nowkeeping S3 open now UNTIL platform falls. We could have a tamp routine in the main loop.

--Consider blinking a button if it is active and could do something? B1 when platform is down; B2 when filling; B3 to depress, lower, open. Probably not.

--Tip fell off once at SACC

--Door sticks sometimes due to stickiness and sometimes due to rubbing.


DONE
=============

--Buff out menu routine

--Add half seconds to autosiphonduration

--Fix lifetime cycles so can go over 255

--vent bottle in pressureDropped loop

--get new start pressure after null loops

--when liquid out connection from keg is not connected (or line is blocked), behavior is the same as filling too fast--pressure goes up. Is there any way to alert user to this? Manual mode

--In idle loop with platform down, change instructions to 

Insert Bottle
B3 opens door

if door is closed

--Make all constants proportional to reg. pressure--WON"T FIX

--Don't EVER drop platform when pressurized.

--IMMEDIATELY close platformUP solenoid if Preg < Pbot and maybe open vent solenoid. This would indicate that gas was turned off with a pressurized bottle in place; closing S4 will lessen the chance that slider pressure will sag and cause a bang.

--Fix funny button flash that happens when no-bottle loop runs when exiting pressure loop

--Raised platform; turned off gas, disconnected gas hose and depressurized, closed door and liquid spewed!!!!!!!!!! FIXED with second pressure sensor

--Should be able to open door in null loop--how else can you get it open to pack it, etc?

--Open door at start (or certainly after a stuck bottle start up)

--Opening door triggers momentary platform down

--Would be nice to shut off gas if bottle pressure isn't rising (ie, no bottle in place)

--Purge no longer works

--closing door with platform up and no bottle starts gas. Button isn't lit. 

--750s wont fill!! closing door only gives a momentary burst of gas

--Button toggle functionality is wonky--if you leave pushed too long, it toggles again WOO HOO

--When bottle automatically depressurizes and platform drops slightly, doesn't end up in right state. Must push B3 again to make right

--When keg runs out of liquid, pressure reading is near zero and buttons don't work right
