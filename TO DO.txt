Closing door after depressurization ends and door opens starts flow of gas

Holding down B1 with door closed starts flow of gas when platform locks in


FEATURES 
========

--Allow tamping by pressing B2 anytime during depressurization (i.e., when platform is up)

--Don't repressurize when stopping depressurization; (but DO repressurize anytime foam touches sensor?)

--Check to make sure that pressure difference is zero when bottle is not pressurized (I think we solved this once...may have lost that change?)
